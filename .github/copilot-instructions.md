Use single quotes for Python strings other than format string which use double quotes.

Use triple double quotes for docstrings and comments with a space on either side
or single-line docstrings. Add :param: to docstrings to document parameters. Add :return: to all functions and methods with a return value.

Use type hints for all function and method arguments and return values.
